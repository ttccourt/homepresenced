# homepresenced
A daemon for determining the presence of members of your household based on MAC addresses. Visualisation with freeboard.

# Installation
I will probably make a .deb package at some point, but for now, you'll have to install manually. Place the homepresenced.py file wherever you want, and run `chmod +x homepresenced.py` to enable execution. Then, add the configuration file in `/etc/homepresenced/homepresenced.yaml`.
